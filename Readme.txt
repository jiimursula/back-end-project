If you want to run the project yourself, it can be downloaded from Github. 
You must have Node.JS and MongoDB installed on your computer. You also have to install 
mongoose, express, dotenv and nodemon in VScode using "npm install" command.

You can start the server in VSCode terminal by writing "npm run devStart". 
You can test the applications e.g. with Postman (url: "http://localhost:5000/books")
